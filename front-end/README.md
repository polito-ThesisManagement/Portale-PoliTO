## Description
This is the front end of the project. It is a React application that consumes data from the back end. The application is written in JavaScript using the React library.

## Installation
To set up and run the front-end, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the front-end directory:
    ```bash
    cd front-end
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the front-end server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will be running at http://localhost:3000.

> **Note:** This guide explains how to run the front-end application. The front-end relies on the back-end API. Ensure the back-end server is running before using the application. To run the back-end server, please refer to the back-end documentation.
